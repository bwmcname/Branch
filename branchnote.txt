Track Graph
-- Only have reachable tracks in the graph.
   - finding edges that are not reachable from the 'current edge' (track the player is on)
     should be quick. Maybe explore all possible paths and mark those reachable, and every one
     not marked after searching gets evicted.
   - All vertices on the graph can have at most two edges, so a fixed adjacency list may work.
